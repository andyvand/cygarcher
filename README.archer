This branch has code to lazily read function bodies when expanding a
DWARF CU.  It is incomplete.  The code to look up blocks by PC must
expand function bodies, but currently does not.

This is a performance improvement when expanding CUs; but simpler to
implement than making CU expansion fully lazy.

It could use more performance testing.  It would also be interesting
to try to measure some lower bounds on CU scanning, say by writing
various test programs using libdw.
