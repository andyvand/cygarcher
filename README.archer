This branch was intended to implement objfile splitting.  The approach
taken here is obsolete, though.  The new approach is to hang shared
data off the BFD.

This branch also has some I/T-set support, mostly user-interface code.

This branch isn't very useful, but is kept around until some of the
above features are resolved, in case any of the code here is still
useful.
